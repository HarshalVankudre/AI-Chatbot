## **‚ú® Key Features**

* **Natural Language to SQL:** Converts plain English (or German) questions into valid SQLite queries.  
* **Smart Intent Classification:** Automatically detects whether you're asking a question about your data or just making small talk.  
* **General Conversation:** Engage in regular conversation when you're not querying the database.  
* **Intelligent Formatting:** Automatically displays results as a clean markdown table for lists of data or as a simple sentence for single-value answers.  
* **Self-Correcting AI:** If an initial SQL query fails, the AI attempts to correct it based on the error message.  
* **100% Browser-Based:** Your database file and API key are never uploaded. All processing happens securely in your browser using SQL.js.  
* **Multi-Language UI:** Switch between English and German on the fly.  
* **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with the latest web technologies for a fast and responsive experience.

## **ü§ñ How It Works**

The application uses a multi-step AI chain to process user input:

1. **Intent Classification:** The AI first determines if the user's message is a database\_query or general\_conversation.  
2. **Branching Logic:**  
   * If **general\_conversation**, the model generates a friendly, conversational response.  
   * If **database\_query**, the application proceeds to the next step.  
3. **Natural Language to SQL:** The model generates an SQLite query based on the user's question and the database schema.  
4. **Query Execution:** The generated SQL is executed against the loaded database file in the browser via SQL.js.  
5. **Intelligent Formatting & Final Answer:** The query results are sent back to the model, which formats them appropriately (table or text) and generates a final, user-friendly response.
